Objective: Exploring large datasets(Weather Data: Approx. 10K with records) and writing SQL queries to handle them

Operations:
1. Connect to DB and dislay all records
2. Fetch earthquakes that happened within 500KM of Arlington, Texas
3. Largest earthquake that occured within 200 km of Dallas
4. Between certain date range, display all the earthquakes that happened on Richter scale(> 3)
5. In last 3 days, how many earthquakes happened between Richter Scale Range: 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-7
6. Given certain radius and two places, where are the earthquakes most common?
7. Based on given range, find clusters of eartquakes in that range
8. Do large earthquakes(with a magnitude > 4) occurs more often at night?
