chapter vi

minute two stood looking house wondering
next suddenly footman livery came running
wood considered footman livery
otherwise judging face would called
fish rapped loudly door knuckles opened
another footman livery round face large eyes like
frog footmen alice noticed powdered hair curled
heads felt curious know
crept little way wood listen

fish footman began producing arm great letter
nearly large handed
saying solemn tone duchess invitation
queen play croquet frog footman repeated solemn
tone changing order words little queen
invitation duchess play croquet

bowed low curls got entangled together

alice laughed much run back wood
fear hearing next peeped
fish footman gone sitting ground near
door staring stupidly sky

alice went timidly door knocked

sort use knocking said footman
two reasons first side door
secondly making noise inside one could
possibly hear certainly _was_ extraordinary
noise going within constant howling sneezing every
great crash dish kettle broken
pieces

might sense knocking footman went
without attending door us instance
_inside_ might knock could let

skimming straight footman head grazed nose
broke pieces one trees behind

next day maybe footman continued tone exactly

frightened mouse splashed way neighbouring pool
could hear rattle teacups march hare friends

ordering unfortunate guests execution pig baby
sneezing duchess knee plates dishes crashed
around shriek gryphon squeaking
lizard slate pencil choking suppressed guinea pigs
filled air mixed distant sobs miserable mock
turtle

sat closed eyes half believed
wonderland though knew open
would change dull reality grass would rustling
wind pool rippling waving reeds rattling
teacups would change tinkling sheep bells queen shrill
cries voice shepherd boy sneeze baby
shriek gryphon queer noises would change
knew confused clamour busy farm yard
lowing cattle distance would take place mock
turtle heavy sobs

lastly pictured little sister
would time grown woman would
keep riper years simple loving heart
childhood would gather little children
make _their_ eyes bright eager many strange tale
perhaps even dream wonderland long ago
would feel simple sorrows find pleasure
simple joys remembering child life happy summer
days

looking could hear tones voice
see queer little toss head keep back wandering hair
_would_ always get eyes still listened
seemed listen whole place around became alive
strange creatures little sister dream

long grass rustled feet white rabbit hurried
frightened mouse splashed way neighbouring pool
could hear rattle teacups march hare friends
shared never ending meal shrill voice queen
ordering unfortunate guests execution pig baby
sneezing duchess knee plates dishes crashed
around shriek gryphon squeaking
lizard slate pencil choking suppressed guinea pigs
filled air mixed distant sobs miserable mock
turtle

sat closed eyes half believed
wonderland though knew open
would change dull reality grass would rustling
wind pool rippling waving reeds rattling
teacups would change tinkling sheep bells queen shrill
cries voice shepherd boy sneeze baby
shriek gryphon queer noises would change
knew confused clamour busy farm yard
lowing cattle distance would take place mock
turtle heavy sobs

lastly pictured little sister
would time grown woman would
keep riper years simple loving heart
childhood would gather little children
make _their_ eyes bright eager many strange tale
perhaps even dream wonderland long ago
would feel simple sorrows find pleasure
simple joys remembering child life happy summer
days

lizard slate pencil choking suppressed guinea pigs
filled air mixed distant sobs miserable mock
turtle

sat closed eyes half believed
wonderland though knew open
would change dull reality grass would rustling
wind pool rippling waving reeds rattling
teacups would change tinkling sheep bells queen shrill
cries voice shepherd boy sneeze baby
shriek gryphon queer noises would change
knew confused clamour busy farm yard
lowing cattle distance would take place mock
turtle heavy sobs

lastly pictured little sister
would time grown woman would
keep riper years simple loving heart
childhood would gather little children
make _their_ eyes bright eager many strange tale
perhaps even dream wonderland long ago
would feel simple sorrows find pleasure
simple joys remembering child life happy summer
days

picking daisies suddenly white rabbit pink eyes ran
close

alice started feet flashed across mind
never seen rabbit either waistcoat pocket
watch take burning curiosity ran across
field fortunately time see pop

deep well

plenty time went look wonder
going happen next first tried look make
coming dark see anything

cupboards book shelves saw maps pictures
hung upon pegs took jar one shelves

disappointment empty like drop jar fear

knowledge one listen still good
practice say yes right distance
wonder latitude longitude got alice

grand words say

presently began wonder shall fall right _through_
earth funny seem come among people walk
heads downward antipathies think rather
glad _was_ one listening time sound

tried curtsey spoke fancy _curtseying_
falling air think could manage
ignorant little girl think asking never
ask perhaps shall see written somewhere

alice bit hurt jumped feet moment
looked dark overhead another
long passage white rabbit still sight hurrying
moment lost away went alice like wind

whiskers late getting close behind
turned corner rabbit longer seen found
long low hall lit row lamps hanging
roof

alice way one side trying every
door walked sadly middle wondering ever

suddenly came upon little three legged table made solid
glass nothing except tiny golden key alice
first thought might belong one doors hall
alas either locks large key small
rate would open however second
time round came upon low curtain noticed
behind little door fifteen inches high tried
little golden key lock great delight fitted

alice opened door found led small passage
much larger rat hole knelt looked along
passage loveliest garden ever saw longed get
dark hall wander among beds bright
flowers cool fountains could even get head
doorway even head would go thought
poor alice would little use without shoulders oh
wish could shut like telescope think could

going _that_ hurry look first said
see whether marked _poison_ read
several nice little histories children got burnt
eaten wild beasts unpleasant things

sooner later

however bottle _not_ marked poison alice ventured
taste finding nice fact sort mixed
flavour cherry tart custard pine apple roast turkey toffee

sister sat still left leaning head
hand watching setting sun thinking little alice
wonderful adventures till began dreaming fashion
dream

hands clasped upon knee bright eager eyes

_would_ always get eyes still listened
seemed listen whole place around became alive
strange creatures little sister dream

long grass rustled feet white rabbit hurried
frightened mouse splashed way neighbouring pool
could hear rattle teacups march hare friends
shared never ending meal shrill voice queen
ordering unfortunate guests execution pig baby
sneezing duchess knee plates dishes crashed
around shriek gryphon squeaking
lizard slate pencil choking suppressed guinea pigs
filled air mixed distant sobs miserable mock
turtle

sat closed eyes half believed
wonderland though knew open
would change dull reality grass would rustling
wind pool rippling waving reeds rattling
teacups would change tinkling sheep bells queen shrill
cries voice shepherd boy sneeze baby
shriek gryphon queer noises would change
knew confused clamour busy farm yard
lowing cattle distance would take place mock
turtle heavy sobs

lastly pictured little sister
would time grown woman would
keep riper years simple loving heart
childhood would gather little children
make _their_ eyes bright eager many strange tale
perhaps even dream wonderland long ago
would feel simple sorrows find pleasure
simple joys remembering child life happy summer
days

looking eggs happens want
_yours_ like raw

well said pigeon sulky tone settled
nest alice crouched among trees well
could neck kept getting entangled among branches
every stop untwist
remembered still held pieces mushroom hands

lizard slate pencil choking suppressed guinea pigs
filled air mixed distant sobs miserable mock
turtle

sat closed eyes half believed
wonderland though knew open
would change dull reality grass would rustling
wind pool rippling waving reeds rattling
teacups would change tinkling sheep bells queen shrill
cries voice shepherd boy sneeze baby
shriek gryphon queer noises would change
knew confused clamour busy farm yard
lowing cattle distance would take place mock
turtle heavy sobs

lastly pictured little sister
would time grown woman would
keep riper years simple loving heart
childhood would gather little children
make _their_ eyes bright eager many strange tale
perhaps even dream wonderland long ago
would feel simple sorrows find pleasure
simple joys remembering child life happy summer
days

time round came upon low curtain noticed
behind little door fifteen inches high tried

looking could hear tones voice
see queer little toss head keep back wandering hair
_would_ always get eyes still listened
seemed listen whole place around became alive
strange creatures little sister dream

long grass rustled feet white rabbit hurried
frightened mouse splashed way neighbouring pool
could hear rattle teacups march hare friends
shared never ending meal shrill voice queen
ordering unfortunate guests execution pig baby
sneezing duchess knee plates dishes crashed
around shriek gryphon squeaking
lizard slate pencil choking suppressed guinea pigs
filled air mixed distant sobs miserable mock
turtle

sat closed eyes half believed
wonderland though knew open
would change dull reality grass would rustling
wind pool rippling waving reeds rattling
teacups would change tinkling sheep bells queen shrill
cries voice shepherd boy sneeze baby
shriek gryphon queer noises would change
knew confused clamour busy farm yard
lowing cattle distance would take place mock
turtle heavy sobs

lastly pictured little sister
would time grown woman would
keep riper years simple loving heart
childhood would gather little children
make _their_ eyes bright eager many strange tale
perhaps even dream wonderland long ago
would feel simple sorrows find pleasure
simple joys remembering child life happy summer
days

wind pool rippling waving reeds rattling
teacups would change tinkling sheep bells queen shrill
cries voice shepherd boy sneeze baby
shriek gryphon queer noises would change
knew confused clamour busy farm yard
lowing cattle distance would take place mock
turtle heavy sobs

lastly pictured little sister
would time grown woman would
keep riper years simple loving heart
childhood would gather little children
make _their_ eyes bright eager many strange tale
perhaps even dream wonderland long ago
would feel simple sorrows find pleasure
simple joys remembering child life happy summer
days

alice beginning get tired sitting sister

without pictures conversations

considering mind well could
hot day made feel sleepy stupid whether pleasure
making daisy chain would worth trouble getting
picking daisies suddenly white rabbit pink eyes ran
close

nothing _very_ remarkable alice think
_very_ much way hear rabbit say oh
dear oh dear shall late thought afterwards
occurred ought wondered
time seemed quite natural rabbit actually _took
watch waistcoat pocket_ looked hurried
alice started feet flashed across mind
never seen rabbit either waistcoat pocket
watch take burning curiosity ran across
field fortunately time see pop

deep well

either well deep fell slowly
plenty time went look wonder
going happen next first tried look make
coming dark see anything
looked sides well noticed filled
cupboards book shelves saw maps pictures
hung upon pegs took jar one shelves
passed labelled orange marmalade great
disappointment empty like drop jar fear
killing somebody underneath managed put one
cupboards fell past

well thought alice fall shall
think nothing tumbling stairs brave think
home say anything even fell
top house likely true

would fall _never_ come end wonder
many miles fallen time said aloud must
getting somewhere near centre earth let see would
four thousand miles think see alice learnt
several things sort lessons schoolroom
though _very_ good opportunity showing
knowledge one listen still good
practice say yes right distance
wonder latitude longitude got alice
idea latitude longitude either thought nice
grand words say

presently began wonder shall fall right _through_
earth funny seem come among people walk
heads downward antipathies think rather
glad _was_ one listening time sound
right word shall ask name
country know please new zealand australia
tried curtsey spoke fancy _curtseying_
falling air think could manage
ignorant little girl think asking never
ask perhaps shall see written somewhere

nothing else alice soon began
talking dinah miss much night think
dinah cat hope remember saucer milk
tea time dinah dear wish
mice air afraid might catch bat
like mouse know cats eat bats wonder
alice began get rather sleepy went saying
dreamy sort way cats eat bats cats eat bats
sometimes bats eat cats see answer
either question much matter way put felt
dozing begun dream
walking hand hand dinah saying earnestly
dinah tell truth ever eat bat suddenly
thump thump came upon heap sticks dry leaves
fall

alice bit hurt jumped feet moment
looked dark overhead another
long passage white rabbit still sight hurrying
moment lost away went alice like wind
time hear say turned corner oh ears
whiskers late getting close behind
turned corner rabbit longer seen found
long low hall lit row lamps hanging
roof

doors round hall locked
alice way one side trying every

strange creatures little sister dream

long grass rustled feet white rabbit hurried
frightened mouse splashed way neighbouring pool
could hear rattle teacups march hare friends
shared never ending meal shrill voice queen
ordering unfortunate guests execution pig baby
sneezing duchess knee plates dishes crashed
around shriek gryphon squeaking
lizard slate pencil choking suppressed guinea pigs
filled air mixed distant sobs miserable mock
turtle

sat closed eyes half believed
wonderland though knew open
would change dull reality grass would rustling
wind pool rippling waving reeds rattling
teacups would change tinkling sheep bells queen shrill
cries voice shepherd boy sneeze baby
shriek gryphon queer noises would change
knew confused clamour busy farm yard
lowing cattle distance would take place mock
turtle heavy sobs

lastly pictured little sister
would time grown woman would
keep riper years simple loving heart
childhood would gather little children
make _their_ eyes bright eager many strange tale
perhaps even dream wonderland long ago
would feel simple sorrows find pleasure
simple joys remembering child life happy summer
days

lizard slate pencil choking suppressed guinea pigs
filled air mixed distant sobs miserable mock
turtle

sat closed eyes half believed
wonderland though knew open
would change dull reality grass would rustling
wind pool rippling waving reeds rattling
teacups would change tinkling sheep bells queen shrill
cries voice shepherd boy sneeze baby
shriek gryphon queer noises would change
knew confused clamour busy farm yard
lowing cattle distance would take place mock
turtle heavy sobs

lastly pictured little sister
would time grown woman would
keep riper years simple loving heart
childhood would gather little children
make _their_ eyes bright eager many strange tale
perhaps even dream wonderland long ago
would feel simple sorrows find pleasure
simple joys remembering child life happy summer
days

looking eggs happens want
_yours_ like raw

well said pigeon sulky tone settled
nest alice crouched among trees well
could neck kept getting entangled among branches
every stop untwist
remembered still held pieces mushroom hands

sister sat still left leaning head
hand watching setting sun thinking little alice
wonderful adventures till began dreaming fashion
dream

hands clasped upon knee bright eager eyes
looking could hear tones voice
see queer little toss head keep back wandering hair
_would_ always get eyes still listened
seemed listen whole place around became alive
strange creatures little sister dream

long grass rustled feet white rabbit hurried
frightened mouse splashed way neighbouring pool
could hear rattle teacups march hare friends
shared never ending meal shrill voice queen
ordering unfortunate guests execution pig baby
sneezing duchess knee plates dishes crashed
around shriek gryphon squeaking
lizard slate pencil choking suppressed guinea pigs
filled air mixed distant sobs miserable mock
turtle

sat closed eyes half believed
wonderland though knew open
would change dull reality grass would rustling
wind pool rippling waving reeds rattling
teacups would change tinkling sheep bells queen shrill
cries voice shepherd boy sneeze baby
shriek gryphon queer noises would change
knew confused clamour busy farm yard
lowing cattle distance would take place mock
turtle heavy sobs

lastly pictured little sister
would time grown woman would
keep riper years simple loving heart
childhood would gather little children
make _their_ eyes bright eager many strange tale
perhaps even dream wonderland long ago
would feel simple sorrows find pleasure
simple joys remembering child life happy summer
days
