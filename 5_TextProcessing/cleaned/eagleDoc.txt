vulture feasts


walked heads turned toward spectacle sun rising higher
splashed mellow light deep crannies bowlders set
bald pates smoothed granite rocks gleam rocks never uncovered
history man

rawley turned looked curiously peter whose eyes upon river
bed feet stumbled along trail anxious reach
dam every man engineer stepping briskly keen glances
going cliffs river haste could forebear
gaze stark denuded canyon bottom great river
halted headlong rush

well uncle peter wish rawley said last said
waiting day could show colorado boss
wanted stop stopped

peter looked smiling faintly

thinking johnny buffalo last night said speaking
others straggling along trail would hear
said succeed fail succeeding failure
rise greater things something like struck
wonder meant tilted head toward river
succeeded stopped colorado shown boss
like dreamed got hunch boy never work
dredger maybe government ideas
self centered plan admit right succeed folks
need river figured calculations

jerry newton overheard last observation stepped faster
behind

ever see flood mr cramer covered pueblo several
places south last big one families
getting believe making snappy bet
find breakfast cooked kitchen save
life know flood means going like crack
doom comes sudden mean tickling gas levers
believe since blast went

peter turned looked frowning

makes take granted dam hold queried
resentfully would stake life almost though
shot low water falling water high water going
last run big general storm believe peak past
anyway realize size cramer dam seem forget
altogether auxiliary dam thrown time seems
necessary

jerry newton saw point saw something else blunt young
man nature blurted retort

sure holding mr cramer worried

peter eyes hardened

lives young fellow two dear

p man silenced looked contritely peter back could
think anything say

look engineer hurrying along lead stopped pointed
call enterprise taking chance care


party pulled facing river reached lower edge
basin rawley johnny buffalo camped bank
high rocky canyon opened slowly mouth river
forced narrower channel held therefore deeper bed

away middle almost edge channel
fighting still hold bent figure groping bent almost double
eyes ground knelt clawed slimy pools
went inch inch like child picking pretty pebbles beach

old jess cried rawley peter old jess call step
hole quicksand dam breaks

crazy several party spoke words sometimes
happens unconsciously forming impromptu chorus call

come peter starting toward edge seeking trail
rawley running ahead place used bring water


go back get shouted peter scrambling left
top gesticulated shouted

go back rawley cried shoulder one enough
reached bottom started

vulture saw flapped arms screamed vituperations
reasonless rage greed mad thinking come rob

slipping sliding among bowlders piled river bed places
two ran instinctively avoiding treacherous bars engulfing mud
lay upstream larger obstruction deep pools fish
leaping neither would turn back men realized

vulture picked rock big fist threatened
went straight old jess gave maniacal scream hurled
rock fled rawley ducked peter coming behind caught
chest lurched slipped slimy spot went backward
rock

rawley see hot old man ran awkwardly
pockets weighted sagged full stretch cloth sample
bag shoulder knocking heavily back headed straight
current boiled miniature colorado channel

meant jump gain side lost sense
proportion see horse could scarcely clear racing flood
rawley shouted warning old jess reached brink old vulture
gave scream sprang current caught dragged

rawley ran steps plunging stream put one foot
quicksand hurled back time black tumbled object
old jess whirled

river never gives dead said rawley exclaimed
awed tone peter turned peter behind
supposed saw lying among litter small mossy rocks

bank men shouting pointing upriver rawley heaved peter
back started picking way toward shore rawley glanced saw
stretched arms looked began running

river close shore looking hugging rocks
protection narrow white line came leaping upon colorado
river submit tamely man found weak spot
close inshore hours fretting
barrier eaten way slim skirmisher came surging
tunnel water made

men scrambled bluff toward well groomed men patent leathers
slipped steep bank could help neither could
stand hands pockets watch

rawley see see gamboling white line
first glance see anything save next place must set
foot next mud bar must avoid shoulders bent
two hundred pound weight man loved never loved
man knew safety might lie second one long stride

rocks seemed grow slippery slimy went mud
banks seemed slide upon turn back time
avoid patch ooze imagined shore receded stood
still moved feet one spot fought notion forced
believe making time small devouring flood
racing kept telling water twice
far travel order engulf must go escape

right water farther travel made time indeed
spectators swore made new record speed running two hundred
pounds back feat man smooth going told
course achievement miracle

however may rawley used last ounce energy reach bank
gloved hand reached caught mate seized wrist
gave final dig toes scrambling wriggle crawled
one pulled peter back small torrent swept past

shelf rock watermark lay back minute breathe
essayed climb high bank looked rush water
eyes wide

lord thought whole river coming panted disgustedly
looking face governor whose hand reached
could jump almost

hardly load governor retorted whole dam may
give way moment started

peter stirred struggled sit dazed eyes went new
torrent sight stung full consciousness came like lion
wounded full fight

come got shoot auxiliary dam shouted thickly
going anyway let flood easy

another rescue


going try rescue body jerry newton looked fussing
one best small cameras market day got
dramatic race flood made apologies enterprise
business get scenes

governor pressed lips together pointed downward

going save living said doctor

shrewd eyed tanned man already feeling peter skull finger
tips seemed detached intelligence

simple contusion announced cheerfully put sleep
minute though fix two shakes feel
like new let look chest

five minutes peter standing steadily feet ready go
rawley caught somber glance place old jess disappeared
shook head unconsciously aping governor

use uncle peter tried get running like mill race
landed square middle

peter swept arm toward bared river bed
eyes sought governor crazy saw half brother would
sense old man get gold government could
beat

looked one face another trying choose stood highest rank

want permission said firmly doctor stimulant took hold
go ahead carry plans warn gentlemen
done may great flood let go ahead shoot
auxiliary dam _now_ relieve pressure shoot
rock hold back flood expense
think best afterwards river

threw hand toward mutinous inshore stream

dam rock tons upon tons inshore channel could
eat cliffs overhang would prevent full drop broken
rock counted natural run broke
anywhere would break nature pretty good engineer gentlemen
make safe proposition shoot auxiliary dam want
free hand answer consequences warn

governor lifted eyebrows great engineer party
engineer looked chairman commission looked river
plainly disliked give word would carry much weight
might lead astray peter walked steadily along governor
rawley held solicitously arm

bear mind studied problem life peter
added urgently spending good deal money laid
plans carefully risk neither lives money people
us safe let go ahead spite high water cramer
dam hold let go ahead finish job

engineer shut technical eyes listened common reason
governor still glancing way steps wanting opinion

good deal engineer said last advise
circumstances permit mr cramer go ahead make dam
safe possible render present danger greater
longer cramer dam holds better chance averting
disaster give little time think promise get river
control without disastrous flood condition arising

peter eyes darkened inference least one point
reflected might happened truly great
men greater training keeping well within red tape
fences

well mr cramer governor said appoint take charge
safeguarding river flood cannot promise immediate
funds however

peter dismissed point gesture

expected finance cramer dam start finish said bluntly
still expect ask left alone

reached flat rock river bank opposite shacks peter
sent glance way saw shacks standing apparently
unharmed dismissed mind thought danger family
engineer beside governor others behind kept
straight dam site wondering maniac old jess
thought remove big launch safe point around bend
might able cross river want
ticklish little points situation bound
admit

rawley let go arm turned away toward camp peter called


gladys nevada cook big breakfast son back hour

nevada close another minute two would see would
plenty talk besides hear voice
thought exultantly would panacea loneliness

neared place stopped though one thrust back
went running run small flood river
shacks stood unharmed save gaping window sashes splinters glass
sticking like flattened icicles edges porch nevada rock faced
dugout cabin stood upright though slightly twisted behind porch
rockwork tumbled confused heap

certain place ruins anita whimpering tearing rock
fingers two older children trying help

get back way rawley went looked place
digging caught breath

little whole thing top
see wall ready topple kid go get pick shovel try

recalled construction place thanking god spent many
days rock cabin set back hill rock
ledge prevailing granite felt sure would hold
anything direct charge explosives far corner dark
closet like recess cut roofed poles corrugated iron
dirt used remembered storeroom never
finished like two rooms front rock walls bare poles
iron showed low roof

pick shovel began digging roof remained intact
worked cursed peter thoroughness constructing place
poles set rather close together spiked heavy
beams oldest boy brought pinch bar rawley throwing back
iron roofing pried pole let blackness

heavy curtain hung doorway storeroom slit beyond
room seemed first dismayed glance completely filled rock
dÃ©bris quite close saw

sitting homemade desk held typewriter spread
books wherein kept records cramer dam
working books blast wrecked place beam
ceiling fallen caught upon another beam pinned bowed
desk perhaps leaning upon folded arms rest
shock came beam lying back holding
upon around rocks piled

rawley set teeth carefully removed rocks girl
crept closer hesitating afraid reached touched fingers
still closed around something holding hand
fingers cool pliable alive could sworn heart
seemed stop altogether gave great jump

gently released thing holding drew toward
old weather scarred briar pipe looked dumbly looked
nevada carefully laid pipe back fingers eyes
blue bright face pale steadied
would get _must_ free bring alive safe outside


fear stabbed going shoot dam much
time another shock peter told look blast
perhaps matter minutes

raised looked beams seemed solidly braced
present though another concussion would likely throw
looked

nevada sitting reed stool two cushions upon give
height crept closer raised set shoulder beam
lay along bowed shoulders steadied took firm hold
cushion pulled beneath

nevada body sagged bit rawley could see daylight

pulled remaining cushion still beam held fast nevada
crushed pinned without bearing weight

rawley went back crouching caved roof arms round nevada

nevada lying bed anita shack trying convince rawley
doctor knew talking doctor declared
nevada injuries mostly superficial bruises nervous shock
sitting cramped one position hours expecting every moment
crushed death nevada seemed rather crestfallen rawley told
simple matter free beam

whole thing caught unawares stopped minute rest
explained defensively think half asleep happened
course lamp smashed flat even think exploding black
dark suppose natural imagine crushed
merely held fast try move afraid whole thing

wonder even wonder rawley
took hand patted sublime disregard
circumstances last visit basin believe omens nevada
fate gave splendid one found rawley smiled
mysteriously eyes twinkling

general wreck old pipe landed cranny right
desk beside make believe fate mean something

freak accident interrupted nevada cheeks showing alarming symptoms
sudden attack fever old pipe take must
tucked somewhere came suppose rattled

rawley eyes never blue like looking upon
sunlit sea dipped fingers pocket nevada blouse
produced pipe turning tenderly hands

god bless day learned smoke murmured eyes still dancing
may rattled know good omen means

oh hush nevada cried sharply struck pipe hand
trails lie together marry ever ever know well
cousins turned face wall

rawley speak looked pipe straight eyes
anita sitting corner like bronze buddha disguised squaw

anita met look stolid obstinacy never blinking never quiver

rawley jaw squared little continued look body swayed
forward eyes boring soul king mounted
looked demanded anita choose jess
cramer rawley know stared knew
truth hidden behind unreadable eyes knew truth
would give nevada moment truth spoken lips anita
might speak truth lips sworn silence

old squaw whimpered breath eyes flickered could
longer look defiance terrible commanding blue eyes eyes
king mounted hand went shield face stare
stirred uneasily chair spread fingers peering
fearfully terrible blue eyes looked still slowly
painfully scarce knowing anita pulled
chair went forward one goes bar justice

flame shoots suddenly dying embers flame dart
ashes youth stooped gross old body straightened anita head
went back eyes glowed little old fire voice rang
clear proud pride ancestry unknown

nevada cried imperiously spoke rapidly indian true
cousin grandson man loved youth
grandson sergeant george king father peter
ashamed know truth ashamed know
stolen love noble lie father peter loved

nevada lay listening gazing fixedly grandmother caught
gnarled old hand anita fondled kissed laughed
softly tears laughter

anita tucked bangs drew two fingers across cheeks dry tears
smiled turned heavily toward rawley

girl say loves love grandfadder girl make good

moment peter walked upon unconscious fact
interrupting interesting conversation peter face grave

nevada mother know anything young jess gladys upset

anita slowly lifted hand face gropingly tucked bangs
eyes fixed dumbly peter face

young jess river said reluctantly walk moonlight

eyes two men met significantly peter turned went
rawley followed

concussion rawley said succinctly edge bank

went river case

yes folks upriver came near getting shot second dam
peter said tonelessly sent man hill wave back stragglers
doctor patching crowd nevertheless well
go look along river may hurt bank

rawley think went peter searched bank
thoroughly halfway caught behind bowlder found young jess hat
managed retrieve bring peter peter turned
hand looked rawley nodded

said shortly ever find

turned away toward shack swung back suddenly faced tremendous
heap broken rock visible midstream farther shore lifted
hands high head face twisted eyes black sublime
fury

damn cried curse thought born greed fostered rapacity
put curse bitter years brought pass
greed gold would filched vulture eye watched
waited years swoop snatch grab never
thought rights men curse thing helped make

born selfishness defiled mighty river god meant
flow land one day blessing mankind made
river monster _you_ driving women little children
homes _you_ god damn traitor mind
brought forth destroyed two worked waited
might pander greed tried destroy dearest thing
earth saw something big beautiful
fool enough think idea spawned devil greed could live noble
achievement

look slimy thing vultures made river leprous
thing vultures croaked little croaked went
died eagle would never stop river leave naked
stinking thing sky good mankind eagle would
tamed river without destroying eagle would run
peacefully within banks helping without hurting river lies
shamed bed magnificent stream men flee terror
two thought feast slime yes could stoop low
root gold like hog mire swept
destruction cheated last prey

done worst helped make
created thought thought tear thing
monument greed self shall tear stone stone
river sweeping majestically sea god
witness thing vultures created shall forgotten eagle
wing shall shadow colorado river undefiled

voice ceased stood hands clenched beside jaw squared staring
dam dream dream fulfilled hated
fulfillment lips moved muttering prophecy johnny buffalo

succeed fail succeeding failure

gloved hand laid friendly fashion peter shoulder turned
looked eyes governor

takes big man man broad vision look upon life work
dare say said governor told kindly look
understanding eyes hearted success
proved failure cramer dam would hold believe wanted
hold right vulture eagle say
shall done river country needs men like peter
shall help build another dam build eagle wing

peter lifted right hand laid upon shoulder governor
eyes blue deep stood space looked

chapter one

king mounted


wide south porch house born rawley king sat
smoking pipe dusk heavy scent thousand roses
fragrant serenity great laurel hedged yard king homestead
charming hot empty spaces desert even somber west wing
brooding old house seemed wrapped peace enfolds lives
moving gently long uneventful months years smoke pipe
billowed lazily upward perfumed air incense burned prodigal son
upon home altar wanderings

old indian johnny buffalo came walking straight arrow across
strip grass beside syringa bushes banked west wing rawley
straightened stared bowl pipe sagging palm hand
far back could remember none ever crossed space clipped
grass hold speech kings johnny buffalo walked steadily
forward halted beside porch

grandfather say come announced calmly turned back
somber west wing

sheer amazement held rawley motionless moment indian spoke
almost forgotten strangeness hidden remote life
grandfather time could toddle rawley taught
must go near west wing house approach brooding old man
wheel chair indian served grandfather rawley
much afraid attempt friendly overtures
vague hints grandfather king quite right mind
brooding melancholy held would suffer one indian
servant near nearly thirty years studied aloofness
grandfather summoned

indian waiting shadowed west porch rawley tardily arrived
steps turned without speaking opened door waiting
rawley pass still dumb astonishment bit awed rawley crossed
threshold first time life stood presence
grandfather

powerful figure old man must youth old age shrunk
sagged shoulders dried flesh upon bones years
could hide breadth shoulders change length
arms eyes piercingly blue lips firm drooping
white mustache snow white hair heavy lay upon shoulders
natural waves made seem heavier really
probably worn old old days frontier eyebrows
domineering jet black whole rugged countenance betrayed
savage strength spirit dwelt back eyes great
gaunt body stopped short knees gray blanket smoothed
lap could hide tragic mutilation could great mustache conceal
bitter lines around mouth

back arizona hey launched abruptly rawley voice
grim face

rawley started perhaps expected cracked senile tone would
fitted better tradition old man mental weakness

got back day grandfather instinctively rawley swung
matter fact manner warding embarrassment amazing
interview

mining expert hey know business

well enough paid working grinned rawley trying
unsuccessfully keep eyes straying curiously around room filled
ancient trophies soldier life half century

much like father bet told meaning
words damned milksop bank clerk drop king blood
body far looks actions went guess thought gold grew bushes
stamped date harvest

remember vaguely never seemed well strong rawley defended
dead father

never king make weakling kings ever produced
_my_ son take look picture bureau mean
king blood johnny give picture

indian moved silently high chest drawers farther wall
lifted enlarged framed photograph evidently copied
earlier crude effort pioneer art placed reverently
rawley hands retreated respectful distance

taken started moorehead expedition 59 six feet two
bare feet ounce soft flesh body man
company throw johnny could tell note pride crept
old man voice

see grandfather give anything
days lord physique

fierce old eyes sparkled bony fingers gripped arms wheel
chair like steel claws

king blood give two legs king yet old
instead hunk meat wheel chair

spirit counts grandfather rawley observed hearteningly
eyes still picture lifting old man face
picture like yet

old man grunted doubtfully eyes fixed sharply upon rawley face
fingers drummed restlessly upon arm chair seeing
young man care free youth yearning secret
indeed stood light old fashioned lamp rawley king
might mistaken original picture costume set
fifty years ahead

johnny get box grandfather king spoke without taking eyes
rawley

old indian slipped away moment returned square metal box
placed old man knees rawley found wondering
mother would say told grandfather king sent
actually talking giving glimpse sealed past
watched grandfather fit key lock metal box

king thank god watched grow six feet
water _your_ blood looks like age johnny
knows remember looked two legs take
good get read em
read em till get good em king

held two worn little books rawley took eyeing queerly one
bible old fashioned leather bound pocket size edition
metal clasp book smaller diary evidently leather
band going around end slipping flap hold secure

bet rawley made voice hearty puzzlement would
permit thanks grandfather

meant em father man get anything em
worth milksop wore spectacles wore pants idea
success shove money people grated window paugh
told ambition came near burning books johnny
could tell stopped time life ever stuck foot
wheel chair anchored reach fire
reach guns killed maybe johnny said wait
maybe kings come like grandfather

wait could watch grow king could
tell set shoulders tone voice way
went straight anything wanted legacy boy king
mounted ask old veterans king mounted
read books lifted bony finger pointed lot
bible read careful

bet grandfather rawley undid clasp opened book politely
old man twisted lips sardonic smile eyes gleamed indigo
blue shaggy black brows reminded something
forgotten dipped box fumbled bit held hand
rawley

mining expert maybe tell picked
eyes bored rawley face

rawley bent head three nuggets gold weighed
hand turned light lamp johnny buffalo lifted
table held close

greenhorns think gold gold rawley grinned last

rawley glanced endearing king smile say liable
fall reckon king mounted put flat
wall quits anyway well searchlight

endearing quality smile eyes waved back
gold rawley would returned keep earned use
settled deeper chair gave great sigh
head dropped back cushions fifty years ago picked em

old man waved away peremptory gesture johnny buffalo
glided door opened held waiting inscrutable
calm race

well good night grandfather glad little talk
hope last always wanted pioneer always felt
like talk times

rawley finding rather difficult even yet bridge silence
lifetime

grew thinking crazy likely easy say old man

old man snapped last two words tone finality reached
pipe johnny buffalo opened door inch wider rawley obeyed
unspoken hint straightway found outside door closed
behind waited listening loth go feud broken
tingled desire know grandfather
wonderful old fighting frontier days king mounted

crazy say rawley muttered made way slowly across
strip grass syringas hope brain keen
grandfather age

stood minutes breathing deep night air saturated
perfume spell grandfather vivid personality strong
upon went mother sat gently rocking beside
rose shaded lamp looking late magazine

talk grandfather rawley announced bluntly
sitting opposite mother studying stranger
indeed minutes spent west wing dealt sharp blow
unquestioning faith mother mrs king dropped magazine
opened lips artificially red gave faint gasp

grandfather mind clear mine rawley stated
challengingly bit old fashioned maybe man live wheel
chair fifty years shut away companionship
keep ideas right minute ask say make
corking old pal full pep would crippled
darned shame never busted feud fifty years ago
nevada think give ten years life
lived right elbow

felt sag pockets brought two little books

always thought mother grandfather king particularly wicked old
party well wrong idea weak head
gave bible made promise read said

_bible _ rawley mother sat sharply mouth remained open ready
words mind seemed unable formulate

bet said read faithfully got good
thank rest life something like meant


rawley king grandfather always atheist worst
type heard father tell used hear grandfather
blaspheme curse god hour making cripple
little boy father mean deeply impressed grandmother
asking every prayer meeting night prayers church soften
husband heart turn thoughts toward god father told
used go home afterwards watch see grandfather heart
softened never got wickeder possible swore horribly
everything nearly father said nearly lost faith prayer
believed congregation never prayed believe
rawley grandfather would bible near sure

rawley assured grinning said legacy


well proves mind crazy mother said grimly
father always felt grandfather king sinned holy ghost
_couldn t_ repent anyway added resentfully
ever get deeded place father wedding
present little grandmother died reserved
west wing long lived deed
interfered molested dies west wing becomes part
property mine course lives pension
keeps awful old indian course pension stops
dies right legacy least bet put curse
bible gave would like

rawley shook head dissentingly darned hard sit wheel chair
fifty years remarked somewhat irrelevantly cuss things
reckon added abruptly say grandfather got bluest
eyes mother ever saw man head thought eyes faded old age
ever notice eyes mother

mother laughed unpleasantly grandfather king never gave
inducement get close enough see eyes seeing porch
west wing enough

laid good deal stress upon past said rawley suppose
present darned little future afraid gave
nuggets would like nugget ring mother

mother glanced nuggets pushed away rawley hand held
cupped palm

grandfather king anything
like poison plant yard ever since came rawley like
poison ivy careful go near want touch anything
belonging hope vindictive woman either

rawley rolling nuggets hand staring abstractedly

queer whole thing said finally feel sort leaning
toward grandfather something eyes know mother must
darned tough legs chopped knees young
husky six feet socks full pep believe understand
grandfather king hunk meat wheel chair called
amazing blue eyes

mother glanced curiously face bluer
rawley observed

rawley looked nuggets forehead wrinkled surprise

oh think mother stood suddenly still shaking
nuggets dull clink hand well hope grandfather passed
traits going need
said drily kissed mother good night




chapter two

johnny buffalo bears another message


room rawley switched light slid big chair
table mother could confess deeply minutes
grandfather king stirred spite attitude toward silent
feud endured nearly thirty years conscious dull
ache remorse without meaning judge parents criticize
manner handling difficult situation rawley felt night
guilty great wrong toward grandfather least
ignored invisible wall stood west wing rest
house king permitted reasonless silence
endure years

matter fact rawley life since twelve spent mostly
away home first military academy suburbs st louis
long hiking trips featured school summer vacations
college special course mineralogy since field
work claimed time home therefore merely place
pleasantly tucked away memory visit mother
jobs

first twelve years life thoroughly accustomed rawley
sight fierce old man long hair legs cut knees
sometimes appeared wheel chair porch west wing attended
indian looked savage enough scalp little boy ventured
close ferocious indian scowled wore hair parted forehead
neck braided two long braids shoulder padded
stealthily place beautifully beaded moccasins fringed
buckskin leggings

nevertheless times grew older rawley
tempted invade west wing find bitterly
grandfather clung feud hurt think old man
isolation interesting companionship cheated
enjoying

pulled two old books pocket handling
precious things grandfather seemed consider bible opened
first undoing old fashioned clasp thumb opening book
flyleaf inscription faded yet distinct yellowed
paper sloping careful handwriting rawley great grandmother sending
king mounted forth upon dangerous missions armed word
god hoping prayerfully doubt would read heed
precepts

beloved son
george walter king

affectionate mother

date thrilled rawley aged twenty six 1858 year
great grandmother inscribed book rawley seemed almost
remote stamp act mexican war thought grandfather king
away back 1858 old enough join missouri mounted
volunteers even made sergeant company make
reputation indian fighter gave old man new dignity
eyes grandson seemed strange grandfather king still
alive could talk days

book strangely contradictory appearance outside
worn scuffed much usage inside crackled faintly
protest unaccustomed handling yellowed leaves clung together
layers rawley must carefully separate line two showed
faint penciled underscores otherwise book look
opened many many years nowhere thumbed soiled frequent
reading man living canvas open sky

looks like old boy simply passed buck rawley grinned
maybe felt one family ought read mother
marked wanted give good start maybe
sir old book pinning onto king mounted mother must
right grandfather never enough religion talk
sure gave sunday school talk funny book stand
call liar

smiled closed book whimsically shaking head joke
make sure guess correct rawley opened bible
could mistake crackly new inside though
yellowed age badly worn outside book proclaimed
story long carrying little reading evidence sincerity
old man pious admonitions conclusive rawley laid bible
consideration took worn old diary

grandfather king betrayed certain lack sincerity reading
faded entries rawley decided king mounted must
impetuous youth learned caution years dates arrivals
departures remained incidents however part
neatly sliced knife stubborn disregard opinion
later readers stubs pages elided left tell
deliberate mutilation record rawley read perfunctorily dry
record obscure scouting trips names commanders long since dead
remembered records

rawley learned grandfather taken part making much
frontier history spoke captain hunt matter fact way
mentioned date certain captain hendley killed
indians somewhere near las vegas nevada next page rawley found
gruesome paragraph

young indian captured battle last week learned
secret devilish poisoned arrows black black
arrows poisoned manner tells since
befriended many small ways doubt word procure
poison animal slain liver removed captured
rattlesnake induced strike liver
injecting poison meat arrow points
afterwards rubbed putrid mass left dry needless say
wound touched poison decayed meat surely causes death
young indian tells certain desert plant
successfully used antidote tell name
plant declared know doctors
tribe know secret

think lied willing tell horrid means making
poison cunning let know antidote
tobacco given wasted information merely
increases dread black arrows rattlesnake venom putrid
liver paugh shall

page missing followed several pages brief entries long lapses
time came page gave glimpse colorful
life

june 1866 board esmeralda arrived el dorado

lapse several months intervened next entry brief
record told closing one romance beginning another

november 15th day married mary jane rawlins able stand

next page one grim line

december 4th 1889 wife mary rawlins king buried day

ended diary memorandum pocket inside cover folded
paper lay snug flat rawley drew forth eagerly held close
lamp face clouded disappointment nothing written
paper save list bible references

legacy old diary interesting enough
tantalizing half pages cut bible references probably given
king mounted mother worn old bible never
read rawley stacked books one upon leaned back
chair staring meditatively filled pipe took three
puffs laughed silently

speedy old bird say much told
bet pages cut fairly sizzled bet cut
time married grandmother also think left one two pages

smoked pipe thoughts gone questing long ago
black arrows dipped loathsome poison young indian girls

grandfather ever thinks bet terrible blue
eyes _couldn t_ forget

went bed imagination still held days fighting old
frontier still building adventures romances dashing blue eyed
king mounted

dreaming indian fight sharp tapping window woke
gray dawn sprang bed still knuckling sleep eyes
saw johnny buffalo standing close open screen indian raised
hand

come quick grandfather dead




chapter three

heart dead


evening funeral rawley sitting
porch staring gloomily cold pipe yard grandfather
death hit harder blow would thought possible shock
coming close heels first keen realization
grandfather king vivid personality left numbed sense
loss

mother evident relief removal unpleasant problem chilled
irritated calm assumption indian must also removed
place master gone seemed rawley almost like
sacrilege place belonged mother right grandfather
generosity rob indian home enjoyed since boyhood
unthinkable

turned head glanced toward west wing eyes following
thoughts dimly outlined figure stood erect upon porch west wing
pity gripped rawley throat pity half conscious admiration even
greatest grief life could bow shoulders johnny buffalo
definite purpose drawn kinship loss rawley
rose crossed grass plot syringas sat top step
west porch

johnny buffalo stood arms folded fringe buckskin sleeves
whipping gently soft breeze rose sun went
staring straight nothing nothingness epitomized future
rawley slanted glance began thoughtfully refilling pipe
silence unconsciously bringing close soul
indian traditions whose race forbade hasty speech

half pipe rawley smoked staring meditatively dusk time
johnny buffalo moved statue brown stone
rawley tipped head sidewise looked

sit johnny want talk

talk useless heart dead said johnny buffalo long
pause came two steps seated straight backed head
beside rawley

man love cold spirit gone left cold heart
dead shall wait glad body dead

rawley felt sharp constriction throat one moment almost hated
mother would drive stricken old man world
know gun temple would kinder drew long breath

would like wait lived intuitively crystallized
thoughts briefest words possible express meaning

johnny buffalo shook head slowly decisiveness could
questioned folded arms across grief laden breast

mother fields wait death friend
shall walk toward land people death finds shall smile

rawley turned mind seeking point argument might
break bitter resolution

cowards wait death life grows hard said last brave man
meets life faces sorrow brave overcome brave
man fights death enemy run away life welcome
enemy grandfather found life hard fifty years grandfather
faced spirit strong

grandfather spirit strong body broken body strong
spirit broken strong body live broken spirit inside

rawley smoke johnny buffalo conceded
privately man fool rawley tried put indian
place discover could something would make life worth
living

people scattered said quietly left mohaves
broken tribe

mohaves people indian corrected calmly
pahute mountains along river call colorado people
lived hunted fought uncle chief proud one day
mother beat stick took bow arrows dried
meat night left people angry ashamed
bow killed two mountain sheep bow hidden rocks
wounded white man digging hillside thought
warrior beaten squaw

great thirst found walking toward mountains
life seen sun go bow arrow could get meat

walking bit deep arm woman put hand

much yelling wagon woman struck many times horse
came galloping grandfather lifted wagon put
horse rode together one saddle loved

mohaves attacked whites gone many days sergeant left
horse wagons crept behind bushes killed many
great warrior proud gun brought death mohave
watched loved saw fall knees lie
face sand jumped horse went creeping
brush dead took gun killed mohaves pretty soon
sergeant looked smiled killed
mohaves captain came put sergeant wagon sat beside
gave water gave food fists beat back
would take joy serving

long time sick town entered every day
every night could open eyes see

sonorous voice ceased monotone indian sat silent staring
past turned head looked full rawley

boy took old man since took
night sergeant could call get answer
day sergeant could look could see sergeant gone
heart gone

enthralled picture vividly painted bold strokes indian
rawley sat hunched pipe cuddling cooling bowl fingers

sergeant grandfather last loved king

making truth thought

back mind went back part house




chapter four

rawley reads bible


room rawley unlocked desk got two books
legacy young technical training spirit
romance called youth something particularly important
something urgent admonition read scriptures
rawley training vague speculations mining engineer
fights guesswork every stage profession

sat books hand began reason thing
cold bloodedly problem mineral formations undid
clasp bible opened looked leaves seeking
hidden paper spent half hour search discovered nothing
message hidden bible grandfather must
meant actual reading text

remembered paper filled references hidden pocket
diary might something significant thought opened
diary took paper glanced list references
scattered book sixty four

opened bible began look first one kings 20 3
leaves stuck together turned groups seemed determined
find kings anywhere book daniel joshua jeremiah
zechariah esther peered seem kings

muttered word frequently found bible laid book went
living room big embossed family bible birth date
date father death pictures
permitted look sunday afternoons good boy mother
gone meeting room could
read leisure

struck immediately bible much read either
leaves thick enough turn singly print large
kings present felt chance finding pencil
paper beside list references one hand
therefore set methodically task twenty six
blood adventurous kings beat strongly veins
found book chapter headed list ran finger
half column third verse read

thy silver thy gold mine thy wives also thy children even
goodliest mine

rawley conscious slight chill disappointment written
fine beautifully exact draftsman handwriting went
doggedly work next reference nevertheless

_psalms_ 73 7 eyes stand fatness
heart could wish

promising promised read seemed
practical method getting grandfather secret purpose
thoughts settled evening hard labor book
paper

finishing work heard mother footsteps
porch rather guiltily closed bible folded notes
mother coming room found rawley standing large window
thoughtfully gazing dark stuffed tobacco pipe
mother religious woman member church took
religion according certain fixed rules reading bible casually
apparently entertainment would required explanation rawley
want explain least mother

listened perfunctory interest account evening
edifications swedish missionary lectured tongue
interpreter escaped could room wanted alone
could try guess riddle grandfather placed

message kind hidden away scriptural
quotations rawley felt absolutely certain first place
seem passages devout person would cherish comfort
held moreover certain verses repeated although text
seem justify emphasis precious metals journeyings
rough country decided dominant note citations
net result confusing say least grandfather really intended
discover meaning jumble furnished
key rawley told disgustedly time midnight
read quotations head ached seemed
meaningless first

grandfather told emphatically lot
bible read carefully enough might statement
meaning deeper old man whim rawley could bring
believe somewhere verses secret lay hidden rawley
mean give solved problem

daylight next morning rawley awoke considered
inspiration swung bed bathrobe shoulders made
stealthy pilgrimage old fashioned library conventional
aggregation works found leather bound sets squatting
haunches inspected certain dim corner filled fiction
type commonly accepted standard chose volume returned bed
leaving one heelless slippers behind absorption
mystery

crawled back bed read poe gold bug breakfast giving
particular attention elucidation cipher contained story
general effect research work illuminating poe cipher
worked numbers whereas grandfather king carelessly
muffled meaning many words unless book chapter verse numbers
intended convey message cipher similar poe

possibility struck rawley middle shaving could wait
put theory test hastily wiped razor lather
one side face opened grandfather old bible index
began setting number book name reference
list thus kings 20 3 became numerals 11 20 3

eagerly work mother called breakfast
mother woman worked industriously cultured
secret ambition called behind back brilliant conversationalist
breakfast therefore always uncomfortable meal rawley whenever
mother attended instructive gathering evening

ate first muffin rawley listened foggy interpretation
swedish lecturer ideas upon universal brotherhood rather sat quiet
mother talked interrupted shockingly

say mother know whether grandfather ever read poe

swallow coffee went mother sunday throat
minutes could reply time rawley decided
perhaps better bother mother cipher patted
back begged pardon asking foolish questions escaped
room spent whole day gold bug opened
page contained poe rule concerning frequency
certain letters occur alphabet

evening fine litter papers scribbled letters
numbers singly groups rawley could get two words made sense
thing simply work grandfather ever read poe gold
bug certainly used pattern

went back sixty four bible verses began studying
could see reason grandfather king claim one wives
children whose eyes stand fatness third fourth verses
intelligible

_proverbs_ 2 1 son thou wilt receive words hide
commandments thee

_ii chronicles_ 1 12 wisdom knowledge granted unto thee
give thee riches wealth honor none kings
thee neither shall thee
like

even next three lent possible personal meaning

_psalms_ 2 10 wise therefore oh ye kings instructed ye
judges earth

_i chronicles_ 22 16 gold silver brass
iron number rise therefore lord
thee

_deuteronomy_ 11 11 land whither ye go possess land
hills valleys drinketh water rain heaven

sea

picked little bible opened must
message hidden rawley felt sure bible
quotations held secret book opened eleventh chapter
deuteronomy verse marked verse made familiar rawley
hours exhaustive study part verse marked however
penciled line drawn faintly beneath certain words

sudden excitement rawley seized fresh sheet paper wrote
marked passage land whither ye go possess land hills
valleys

painstakingly began beginning reference list worked
way book chapter verse time used
grandfather bible copied parts verse
underscored right track wrote excitement
grew apace hopeless jumble verses conveyed message

gold mine heart could wish son thou wilt
receive words hide commandments thee give thee
riches wealth none kings
thee wise therefore instructed gold
number land whither ye go possess land hills
valleys son go city
river wilderness yet making many rich midst thereof
ferry boat brink river take victuals
journey turn northward wilderness
great high mountain cedar trees abundance scattered
face high mountain cliffs path
fowl knoweth vulture eye hath seen come
top mount pass unto side westward
hillside great heap stones joined dry tree
go clefts rocks tops jagged rocks
sides pit take heed exceeding deep
hid eyes living creep midst thereof
eastward two hundred fourscore eight feet ye shall
find pure river water proceed gold
heavier sand pure gold upon sand
gold thou shalt take shalt thou prosper thou takest
heed know thy poverty thou art rich take heed
hillside upon bank river wilderness
shall vultures also gathered ye shall find
mine enemy mouth full cursing
tongue mischief vanity watchful heart desperately
wicked keepeth mouth keepeth life put trust
thee son lord thee prosper thou

first impulse find johnny buffalo folded paper slipped
safely pocket reached hat neglected ask
indian meant make camp felt sure could
find indeed stopped path halfway front gate
looked toward west wing could discern figure standing
porch crossed grass plot moment stood johnny

confidence evening

read stated quietly know grandfather
meant go inside read

door locked johnny buffalo pointed one finger shoulder
new lock put mother want go

rawley pressed lips tightly together dared trust
speak looked barred door thought room seen
furnishings enriched hundred little mementoes past belonged
soldier grandfather swift panicky fear mother would
call second hand furniture dealer take price offered
stuff promised would prevent costs

come room invited want read discovered

house mother go camp

light camp fire mississippi flowing
majestically past stars rawley first read complete
document scriptural fragments contained grandfather message
away northeast lights st louis set sky aglow little
lapping waves crept like licking lips bank whispery sound
mingled pleasantly subdued crackling fire across
leaping flames johnny buffalo sat brown corded hands upon
knees black braids drawn neatly forward across chest lean face
high nose cheek bones flared light grew shadowed
flames reached toward drew away lips pressed firmly together
learned well lesson setting seal
thoughts

one point thought might able tell rawley said
looking across fire finished reading city
river wilderness midst thereof ferryboat
brink river know place meant el
dorado nevada grandfather diary tells going river el
dorado remember kind bible reference written
name remember though look
make sure directions start point

northward

indian reached hand lifted stick wood laid across
fire eyes turned toward river

feel want way go johnny buffalo

something much like smile stirred old man lips took rawley
hand gave solemn shake way
indian

go like sergeant held arms gave
water canteen son go go




chapter five

city forsaken


storekeeper nelson stood little slant roofed porch mopped
beaded forehead blue calico handkerchief desert wrinkles
around eyes drew together deepened squinted across acarpous
gulch rough board shacks stood forlorn uncurtained windows
heat ridden hillside beyond

going awful hot river observed
deprecatingly find water pretty muddy maybe know
strangers always best make sure bucket
something settle water advise take one along
extra one could lend need

bucket thanks rawley stepped dust covered car loaded
camp outfit el dorado right mouth canyon

storekeeper gave odd look el dorado answered drily
whole canyon el dorado used town mouth
canyon gone years ago better take left hand road
get quarter mile take past
techatticup mine turn right two shacks stand close
together fork road trail washed know
could get way car good shape pull back
pretty steep coming way

pulled everything struck far rawley replied cheerfully
cars make

holler help long hard drag wash
tackle hot part day need plenty water
storekeeper added whimsical half smile hot part day
time sunrise dark get _awful_ hot
mean knock district added like see
one start canyon without knowing expect
want go business

way look rawley agreed expect
good

storekeeper wiped fresh collection beads forehead looked
canyon rather wistfully

many years old said quietly came
twenty five years ago

rawley laughed year old landed seems long
back stepped starter waved hand storekeeper
went grinding away steep trail loose sand johnny
buffalo sitting beside lifted hand laid arm

stop calls said

rawley stopped car head tilted outward looking back storekeeper
coming trail toward

forgot tell bad indian loose hills somewhere along
river panted came waylaid couple prospectors
know blood feud whites indians tell may
run across well keep eye

name johnny buffalo turned head stared hard


name queo middle aged somewhere late forties
say medium sized kind stocky built kill get grub tobacco
seeing two might try anything careful
place price head tries tricks
waved hand grinned expressively turned back store

older man thinks said johnny buffalo silence queo
almost many years children fought
bad kill pleasure coward

price head probably left country rawley
remarked indifferently old timers fine people
like tell wild tenderfeet suppose human nature

johnny buffalo argue point seemed content gaze hills
effort locate old landmarks rawley mind
wholly absorbed mission country dreamed
month delay getting started first
could well curtail length visit mother spite
fact seemed little common thought wise
make trip kingman report upon property
sold good sized fortune job netted several hundred dollars
likely need wherefore necessity plenty time
dream fortune might lying hills cleft
jagged rocks waiting find

first somewhat skeptical fifty years long time
gold remain hidden hills mining country rich nevada
without prospector discovering johnny buffalo believed whether
belief based solely upon faith sergeant rawley could
determine johnny buffalo plausible argument favor
gold remaining grandfather king left underground stream

fact rawley exhorted take victuals journey meant
distance good many miles perhaps must travel el dorado
go top high mountain pass
side johnny buffalo argued start made el dorado
merely mountain would visible point would
rough country contended code mentioned cliffs great heaps
stones clefts jagged rocks deep pit hid eyes
living final goal thought likely grandfather
king gold mine still undiscovered toward last rawley
much inclined believe read diligently mining
information could get concerning particular district far back
records went nowhere mention made rich placer discovery
mountain

thinking drove devious twistings turnings
canyon road another mine two passed nosing carefully
hill steeper others turned sharply left
final discomfort wash veritable sweat box
particular hot afternoon july baked barren hills rose close either
side like deep gravelly river bed long since gone dry wash sloped
steeply toward colorado rawley could readily understand
solicitude storekeeper return quite likely time
tribulation

expected come upon camp sort canyon opened
bleakly river hot sand floor sloping steeply meet
lapping waves turgid stream water edge first high
ground bank ruins old stamp mill might
built ten years ago hundred far looks went

left car climbed upon cement floor old mill
first seemed greater extension plant discovered
walled roadway winding crest hill swung gazed
northward bible code commanded travel
mile river walls deep canyon black canyon
according map farther away set back river mile perhaps
two miles sharp pointed hill shouldered fellows seemed
highest mountain far could see direction
great high mountain described code journey would
long johnny buffalo anticipated

nearer view desolation simmering heat hundred yards away
opposite bank wash forlorn ruins cabin two gave
melancholy evidence men worked laughed
loved perchance looked furnace yawning beside
muddy water swirling drunken haste might
grandfather landed steamboat _gila_ watched
lovely young half breed girl crowd come welcome boat
passengers

started johnny buffalo spoke elbow indian reached
spot unheard unseen rawley know johnny buffalo pointing
north

think high mountain must go said one day
travel go day sun behind mountains walk
stars early morning walk
hot reach trees cool

lot grub things car rawley objected seems
bad plan carry stuff cache
somewhere old mill friend queo show
much steal want make camp
mountain come carry stuff need
hundred dollars worth outfit car johnny added frugally
keeping

johnny buffalo looked mountain looked car
grunted reluctant acquiescence rawley laughed

right mountain run away night bantered
slapping hand johnny buffalo shoulder affectionate
familiarity bred past month juggling car
desert trails since sunrise object taking easy
hours

johnny buffalo said began helping unload car
chose trail carried loads upper level
cement floored tracks would show chose hiding place beneath
wreckage machinery fallen bank way
open space left beneath large enough hold outfit

huge rattlesnake protested stridently disturbed rawley drew
automatic meaning shoot johnny buffalo stopped
warning gesture killed snake rock still
writhing smashed head picked tail took long step
two heaved river grinning satisfaction deed well
done

rawley standing back watching swift vision old indian
paddling solemnly yard near west wing
incongruous figure amongst syringas roses although
discarded showy fringed buckskin orthodox brown khaki clothes
desert somehow fitted surroundings became part
wilderness johnny buffalo assuredly coming




chapter six

trails meet


sunrise ready trail light packs filled canteens
slung upon shoulders car backed bluff would
shade scorching sunlight early afternoon sundown beside
embers mesquite wood fire boiled coffee
fried bacon cool dawn safeguard loss car
rawley disconnected breaker points distributor carried
carefully wrapped pocket would moving car
power points replaced johnny buffalo
advised leaving things car ward suspicion
outfit cached furthermore cunningly obliterated tracks
deep fine sand ruins stamp mill even keen
predatory eyes outlaw indian could scarcely distinguish trace
many trips way

crossed wash turned remnant old road leading
bank level followed trail river johnny
buffalo stopped pointed bank

ferryboat went explained much land eaten
river since last saw place many houses stood gone
gone people gone like town queo heard
white men hunt hunt wolf

rawley nodded words felt something
inexpressibly melancholy desolation grandfather found
riotous life fortunes gathered fortunes lost hopes
fulfilled hopes crushed slowly long monotonous days toil
disappointment man could tell river rushing heedlessly past
hurried years ago meet lumbering little river
boats struggling current burden human emotions
river might told town born died
grim hills standing stood since land making
looking saturnine calm upon puny endeavors men whose lives
would soon enough cease upon earth forgotten rawley boot toe struck
something loose gravel child shoe toe worn
gaping mouth heel worn last outer edge dry
bleached bone warped many storm blackened doleful even young man
setting quest fortune picturesque secret code
pocket may forgiven sending thought child scuffed
coarse little shoe el dorado

presently johnny buffalo leading way briskly sharp old eyes
taking everything within range eagerly verifying
memories place turned trail along river entered
hills moccasined feet clung tenaciously steep places
rawley high laced mining boots slipped sun rays struck fiercely
little stinging gnats grandfather king mentioned
diary pester poising vibrantly eyes
waited opportunity dart lids

thought perhaps grandfather come way fifty years ago
filled toil climbing long gully peculiar interest fifty
years ago hills must looked much fifty years ago
prospect holes passed occasionally may fresh turned earth
rocks men searching rich silver gold might seen plodding
along hillsides hills could changed much
grandfather looked upon divided thoughts perhaps
gold latest infatuation half breed girl anita
suddenly rawley put vague speculation words

hey johnny good place make smoke shade waited
indian retraced dozen steps johnny
beautiful half breed girl grandfather made last trip
river half spanish grandfather mentioned twice
diary remember

many beautiful girls tribe johnny buffalo retorted drily
name call

anita pretty name proves spanish say

old man stared opposite slope mouth grew thin lipped
stern

uncle chief betrayed old age youngest squaw loved
spanish man noble look tale older brothers told
child bore child spanish gentleman uncle
youngest squaw died johnny buffalo paused significantly child
given mother keep name anita beautiful
remember many visits anita made friends near place think
good sergeant look upon love
heard brothers whisper anita looked soft eyes upon white
soldiers

rawley young sympathies suffered definite revulsion grandfather
_dulce corazon_ coquette fruitless waiting return
beautifully tragic white soldiers stationed
along river rawley remembered curl lip romantic
imagination balked savage blood veins since
beauty fifty years ago sturdy souled youth
old fashioned notions concerning virtue finished smoke went
feeling cheated cold facts almost forced johnny buffalo

reached head gulch climbed steep high ridge
must use hands well feet climbing dug heels earth
descent even steeper rawley told would soon
start follow crow country follow johnny buffalo
one word evidently omitted indian english education
grandfather king word detour rawley thought straight forward
march locusts read wondered johnny buffalo
taken lessons youth

however consoled thought straight line
mountain would undoubtedly shorten distance indian could climb
sneer walls rock like lizard rawley would attempt follow
would ultimately arrive destination though glimpse
obtained mountain ridge crossed failed
confirm johnny buffalo assertion one day travel
walking three hours rawley watch mountain looked even farther
away el dorado johnny buffalo evidently enjoying every
minute hike native hills rawley could bear
spoil pleasure even hinting blazing mighty rough trail

working another tortuous ravine even johnny buffalo
could always keep straight line sun places walls overhung
gulch shelving weather worn cliffs soft limestone bowlders washed
heights made slow going half time climbing
around huge obstruction rattlesnakes
must look well hand foot laid johnny buffalo still
lead rawley youth splendid stamina finding
indian slow pacemaker indeed perfectly satisfied
dozen feet lengthen fifteen twenty

mounting sun made heat gully terrific thing endure
indian lift canteen mouth rawley
learned foolishness drinking freely beginning journey
johnny buffalo stopped suddenly act passing around
jutting ledge rawley halted tracks waited see
reason

indian glanced back crooked forefinger rawley set one foot
carefully two rocks planted circumspectly
without sound stole johnny buffalo side johnny waited
shoulders touched leaned forward pointed

ridge couple hundred yards man moved crouching
behind bush came open bent lower peered downward actions
stealthy whole manner inexpressibly furtive back toward
ridge hid thing stalking

deer maybe mountain sheep rawley whispered
man laid rifle across rock settled lower haunches

still well see sees johnny buffalo whispered back
stalk stalks kill

indian squirmed shoulder strap sling held rifle
case behind seeming deliberation yet speed uncased
weapon worked lever gently make sure gun chamber loaded
motioned rawley follow

hills old man somehow slipped leadership
rawley obeyed without word stole side gulch
man ridge could discover without turning completely
around would destroy position beside rock risk loss
shot game seemed wholly absorbed watching something
farther side ridge seem likely would hear

little farther ledge cutting across head gulch hid
completely two impulse seized rawley cross gulch
climb ridge farther nearer spot man seemed
watching caught attention johnny buffalo whispered
desire received nod understanding consent johnny would keep
straight come behind fellow

unaccountably rawley wanted hurry wanted see man quarry
shot fired wrinkle ridge made easy climbing
afforded concealment went tiny gully digging toes
trying keep soft ground sliding rocks could betray

unexpectedly deep wrinkle brought notch ridge beyond
another gully led steeply downward immediately beneath narrow
trail wound sinuously climbing beyond around point another hill
could see man ridge could doubt
rifle aimed point along trail standing rock
reconnoitering expecting every moment hear shot
unmistakable sound voices came somewhere listened
glance going ridge bit trail showed farther away
point opposite hill thought flashed mind
man rifle could easily seen persons coming around
point must lying wait whoever coming must pass
along trail directly beneath watcher ridge would easy
rifle shot matter hundred yards downhill

stepped rock started running steep gully
trail judged fully hundred yards trail
